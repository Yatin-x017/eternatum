## 2026-01-25 - [Accessibility Wins: Skip Links and Progress Bars]
**Learning:** Adding a "Skip to Content" link is a major accessibility win for keyboard users in apps with complex hero sections and navbars. Progress bars must have semantic ARIA roles to be perceivable by screen readers.
**Action:** Always include a skip link at the top of the main layout and ensure all progress indicators use `role="progressbar"` with appropriate aria attributes.
